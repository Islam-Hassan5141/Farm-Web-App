# The Village Portfolio Project
This is a portfolio project I made. It's originally a request from my father, which shows how I am able to handle clients' orders with ease and efficiency.

## Technical Skills
What appears from my skillset in computer programming are the following:

### Programming Languages
* Python
* HTML, CSS and JS

### Concepts And Paradigms
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Website Designing
* Responsive and flexible structure to fit on all devices
* Backend server and templating
* Self-hosting on a local machine & unit service files on Linux machines
* Using hosting services like Cloudflare
* MVT-based full stack development

### Tools and Frameworks
* Django
* Bootstrap
* Git
* WhiteNoise
* Gunicorn
* Cloudflared

## Non-Technical Skills
This project exhibits my handling of customer's request, as well as adding unique features that they have asked for. I also know how to choose what tools and frameworks I should use to work efficiently, quickly, and effortlessly. This website is an example, as I knew what web framework I should work with when my father told me about this project, as well as what could make the project much easier like using Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
